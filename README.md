Scala Simulation for the Galton-Watson Process


The Galton-Watson process is the anchor of many genetic 
studies and has been extensively studied in several
scholarly articles. Mostly by mathematical means.
This scala code takes another approach and can  run thoudand 
and millions of Monte
Carlo Simulations to estimate the survival probabilities
of lineages (seedNodes) with various lambda value 
(i.e. average number of descendants). 

The advantage of 
the simulation approach is that simulations can easily 
be extended with lot more complex models, while mathematical approach has significant
limitation when increasing the complexity.
